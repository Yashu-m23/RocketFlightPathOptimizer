# Rocket Flight Path Optimizer

## Overview

The **Rocket Flight Path Optimizer** is a Python project that simulates the vertical flight of a rocket and optimizes engine parameters to minimize fuel consumption and time to reach a target altitude. This project uses physics-based modeling, numerical integration, and optimization techniques to provide insights into rocket performance.

## Features

- Simulates rocket flight dynamics including thrust, gravity, and mass depletion.
- Uses SciPy optimization to find the best thrust and specific impulse parameters.
- Visualizes flight data with plots for altitude, velocity, and mass over time.
- Includes an animated flight path visualization using Matplotlib.
- Provides a simple GUI for parameter input and running simulations.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Tkinter (for GUI)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install required Python libraries:

pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
